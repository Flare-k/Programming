\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a \
medical training system for breast tumor palpation based on haptic \
augmented reality (AR) technology. Haptic AR is an emerging \
research area in haptics and virtual reality\
(VR), which is concerned \
with augmenting the haptic \
properties of a real object by means of virtual haptic \
feedback. The AR-based tumor palpation system \
consists of a real breast sample.}
